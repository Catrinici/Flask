# Coding Dojo Python (Flask)
### Using python in a micro-framework

#### In this section we covered how python can be used to create full-scale web applications with the help of the Flask.
#### Main concepts were:
* ##### Rendering Templates
* ##### Redirecting Routes
* ##### Form Data
* ##### GET & POST requests
* ##### Session

# Projects

* ##### UnderStanding Routing
  > Create a server file that generates 5 different http responses
  >- Practice building a server with Flask from Scratch  
  >- Get Comfortable with routes and passing information to the routes  

* ##### Playground
  >Level 1: When a user visits localhost:5000/play, have it render three beautiful looking blue boxes  
  >Level 2: When a user visits localhost:5000/play/(x), have it display the beautiful looking blue boxes x times  
  >level 3: When a user visits localhost:5000/play/(x)/(color), have it display beautiful looking boxes x times, but this time where the boxes appear in (color). 
  
  >- Get comfortable passing information from the route to the template  
  >- Understand how to display information passed from the route in the template file  
  >- Get comfortable with using for loops in the template file  
  >- Get comfortable with using if statements in the template file  

* #### Checkerboard
  >- Continue to learn how to pass information from the url to the route  
  >- Get comfortable passing information from the route to the template
  >- Understand how to use for loop properly in the template
  >- Recognize the value of creating a html/css first and then adding logic/code
  
* #### HTML Table
  >- Get comfortable passing information from the route to the template
  >- Get very comfortable iterating through a list of dictionaries to generate a html output.  


* #### Dojo Fruit Store
  > Build a small web app of a fruit store where a student can select fruit and input their name and student Id  
  Have a check out page give the time and date the order was placed as well as a summary of fruit ordered and   
  student information
  
  >- Get more comfortable with POST and passing information via a form  
  >- Understand how to reference static css or images
  >- Practice using Git (especially git clone)
  >- Learn the importance of making your key assignments/projects look better
  >- Understand how your workflow may be like if you first worked on the HTML/CSS and how it's better
  >- Understand why rendering HTML on a URL that received a POST is a bad idea  
  

* #### C+R Friends 
  > Create an application that allows users to view all friends and add new ones
  
  >- Create a Flask application that displays data from a MySQL database
  >- Take user input and add it to the database
  >- Practice redirecting after going to a POST route 

* #### Leads and Clients 
  > create a simple report dashboard using jQuery charts and graphs
  
  >- At a deeper level, understand how the server generates a http response which the browser can use to render the html/css or to give to the Javascript interpreter.
  >- Have you get exposure to generating beautiful graphs/plots using jQuery and know how to insert information from the database to Javascript.

* #### Email Validation with DB
  > Create an application that asks a user to enter an email address and validates whether that email is valid and whether it exists in the database  
  > Once a valid email address is entered, save to the database the email address the user entered. On the success page, display all the email addresses entered along with the date and the time when the email addresses were entered  
  
  >- Practice fetching data from a database connected to a Flask application
  >- Validate user input before adding it to the database
  >- Practice using flash messages
  >- Practice redirecting after going to a POST route
  

* #### The Wall
  > Build a Message wall Using Flask. User should be able to register and log in. Once a user logs in, allow the logged in user to send a message to other users as well as read all the messages sent to the logged in user. 
  > Users should be able to delete a message that has only been sent to that individual user.
  
  >- Practice connecting a Flask application to a MySQL database
  >- Include login and registration
  >- Include one-to-many relationships
  >- Continue to think about web security and how others could potentially hack your site
